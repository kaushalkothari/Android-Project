<br>1.Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</br>
<br>2.At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</br>
<br>3.C is bad. Go back to A.</br>
<br>4.At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</br>
<br>5.D is bad. Go back to A.</br>
<br>6.At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</br>
<br>7.At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</br>
<br>8.At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</br>
<br>9.E is good. Congratulations!</br>
<p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

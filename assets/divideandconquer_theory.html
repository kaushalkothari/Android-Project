<center><h1>Divide And Conquer Algorithms</h1> </center>
In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
<h2>Advantages</h2> 
<br>1.Solving difficult problems</br>
<br>2.Algorithm efficiency</br>
<br>3.Parallelism</br>
<br>4.Memory access</br>
<br>5.Roundoff control</br>
<h2>Implementation Issues</h2> 
<br>1.Recursion</br>
<br>2.Explicit stack</br>
<br>3.Stack size</br>
<br>4.Choosing the base cases</br>
<br>5.Sharing repeated subproblems</br>

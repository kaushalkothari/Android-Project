<h3>Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem</h3>
<p>From a dynamic programming point of view, Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the Reaching method.</p>

<p>In fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm, namely</p>

<p>Problem 2. Find the path of minimum total length between two given nodes P and Q.</p>

<p>We use the fact that, if R is a node on the minimal path from P to Q, knowledge of the latter implies the knowledge of the minimal path from P to R.

is a paraphrasing of Bellman's famous Principle of Optimality in the context of the shortest path problem.</p>

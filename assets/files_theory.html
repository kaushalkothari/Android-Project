<center><h1>File</h1> </center>

A file represents a sequence of bytes, does not matter if it is a text file or binary file. 
C programming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level)
calls to handle file on your storage devices. This chapter will take you through 
important calls for the file management.

<p>Function of File Handing</p>
<h2>1.Opening Files</h2>
You can use the fopen( ) function to create a new file or to open an existing file, 
   this call will initialize an object of the type FILE, 
   which contains all the information necessary to control the stream. 
<p>Syntax:</p>
FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );
<h2>2.Closing a File</h2>
  To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is:
<p>Syntax:</p>
int fclose( FILE *fp );
<h2>3.Writing a File</h2>
 Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream:
<p>Syntax:</p>
int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );
<p> The function fputc() writes the character value of the argument c to the output stream 
         referenced by fp. It returns the written character written on success otherwise EOF 
         if there is an error. You can use the following functions to write a null-terminated </p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
int fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp );
 <p>The function fputs() writes the string s to the output stream referenced by fp. 
    It returns a non-negative value on success, otherwise EOF is returned in case of any
    error. You can use int fprintf(FILE *fp,const char *format, ...) function as well 
    to write a string into a file.</p>
<h2>4.Reading a File</h2>
   Following is the simplest function to read a single character from a file:
<p>Syntax:</p>
 int fgetc( FILE * fp );
 <p> The fgetc() function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. 
    The return value is the character read, or in case of any error it returns EOF. 
    The following functions allow you to read a string from a stream:</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
 char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );
 <p> The functions fgets() reads up to n - 1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp. 
  It copies the read string into the buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the string.</p>
<h2>5.Fseek Function</h2>
<p>In the C Programming Language, the fseek function changes the file position indicator for 
the stream pointed to by stream.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
int fseek(FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence);

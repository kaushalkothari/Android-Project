<h2>Hashing Example</h2> 
<body>
<p>The example of a hash function is a book call number. Each book in the library has a unique call number. A call number is like an address: it tells us where the book is located in the library. Many academic libraries in the United States, uses Library of Congress Classification for call numbers. This system uses a combination of letters and numbers to arrange materials by subjects.

A hash function that returns a unique hash number is called a universal hash function. In practice it is extremely hard to assign unique numbers to objects. The later is always possible only if you know (or approximate) the number of objects to be proccessed.

Thus, we say that our hash function has the following properties

1.it always returns a number for an object.
2.two equal objects will always have the same number
3.two unequal objects not always have different numbers </p>

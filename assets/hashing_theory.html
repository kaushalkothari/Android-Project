<center><h1>Hashing</h1> </center>

<body><p>The problem at hands is to speed up searching. Consider the problem of searching an array for a given value. If the array is not sorted, the search might require examining each and all elements of the array. If the array is sorted, we can use the binary search, and therefore reduce the worse-case runtime complexity to O(log n). We could search even faster if we know in advance the index at which that value is located in the array. Suppose we do have that magic function that would tell us the index for a given value. With this magic function our search is reduced to just one probe, giving us a constant runtime O(1). Such a function is called a hash function . A hash function is a function which when given a key, generates an address in the table </p></body>

<body><p>An algorithm is a receipe or a systematic method containing a sequence of instructions to
solve a computational problem. It takes some inputs, performs a well defined sequence of
steps, and produces some output. Once we design an algorithm, we need to know how well
it performs on any input. In particular we would like to know whether there are better
algorithms for the problem. An answer to this rst demands a way to analyze an algorithm
in a machine-independent way. Algorithm design and analysis form a central theme in
computer science. </p></body>

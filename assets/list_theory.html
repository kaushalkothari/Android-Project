<center><h1>Linked List</h1> </center>
In computer science, a linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
Under the simplest form, each node is composed of a data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence;
more complex variants add additional links. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
<h2>Singly Linked List</h2>
Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as a 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. 
Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.
<h2>Doubly linked list</h2>
In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. 
The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous').
<h2>Circular Linked list</h2>
In the last node of a list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value used to indicate the lack of further nodes. 
A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked';
otherwise it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'.

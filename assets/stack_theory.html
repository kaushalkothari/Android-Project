<center><b>Stack</b> </center>
In computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: 
1.push adds an element to the collection; 2.pop removes the last element that was added. 
The term LIFO stems from the fact that, using these operations, the last element "popped off" a stack in series of pushes and pops is the first element that was pushed in the sequence. 
This is equivalent to the requirement that, considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack.

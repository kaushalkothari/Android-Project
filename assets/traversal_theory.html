<h2>Tree Traversal</h2>
Tree traversal (also known as tree search) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (examining and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once, in a systematic way. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.
<h2>Types</h2>
<h3>Depth-first</h3>
There are three types of depth-first traversal:
<p>Pre-order</p>
	 <br>1.Display the data part of root element (or current element)</br>
	  <br>2.Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.</br>
	   <br>3.Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.</br>
<p>In-order (symmetric)</p>
	   <br>1.Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.</br>
	  <br>2.Display the data part of root element (or current element).</br>
	<br>3.Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.</br>
<p>Post-order</p>
	<br>1.Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.</br>
	<br>2.Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.</br>
	<br>3.Display the data part of root element (or current element).</br>
<h3>Breadth-first</h3>
Trees can also be traversed in level-order, where we visit every node on a level before going to a lower level. This search is referred to as breadth-first search, as the search tree is broadened as much as possible on each depth before making going to the next depth.

<p>Example – Hierarchy of the Participants in a Project
We have a team, responsible for the development of certain software project.
The participants in it have manager-subordinates relations. Our team consists of 9 teammates:</p>
<img src="tree_example.jpg">
<p>What is the information we can get from this hierarchy? The direct boss of the developers is the "Team Leader", but indirectly they are subordinate to the "Project Manager". The "Team Leader" is subordinate only to the "Project Manager". On the other hand "Developer 1" has no subordinates. The "Project Manager" is the highest in the hierarchy and has no manager.
The same way we can describe every participant in the project. We see that such a little figure gives us so much information.</p>

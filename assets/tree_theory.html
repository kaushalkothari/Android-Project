<center><h1>Tree</h1> </center>
<h2>Definition</h2>
A tree is a (possibly non-linear) data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle. The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.
<h2>Terminologies used in Trees</h2>
<br>•Root – The top node in a tree.</br>
<br>•Parent – The converse notion of child.</br>
<br>•Siblings – Nodes with the same parent.</br>
<br>•Descendant – a node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.</br>
<br>•Ancestor – a node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.</br>
<br>•Leaf – a node with no children.</br>
<br>•Internal node – a node with at least one child.</br>
<br>•External node – a node with no children.</br>
<br>•Degree – number of sub trees of a node.</br>
<br>•Edge – connection between one node to another.</br>
<br>•Path – a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.</br>
<br>•Level – The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.</br>
<br>•Height of tree –The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.</br>
<br>•Height of node –The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.</br>
<br>•Depth –The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.</br>
<br>•Forest – A forest is a set of n = 0 disjoint trees.</br>
